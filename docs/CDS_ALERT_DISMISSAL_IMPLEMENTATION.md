# CDS Alert Dismissal Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ Completed

## Overview

Implemented persistent dismissal and snooze functionality for CDS alerts across the WintEHR application, allowing users to dismiss or temporarily hide clinical decision support alerts with proper persistence and feedback tracking.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created CDSAlertPersistenceService
- **File**: `/frontend/src/services/cdsAlertPersistenceService.js`
- **Features**:
  - Persistent storage of alert dismissals in localStorage
  - Snooze functionality with expiration timestamps
  - Patient-specific alert management
  - Automatic cleanup of expired dismissals/snoozes
  - Support for permanent and temporary dismissals

### 2. Updated CDSPresentation Component
- **File**: `/frontend/src/components/clinical/cds/CDSPresentation.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated `cdsAlertPersistenceService` for persistent storage
  - Updated dismissal handler to persist dismissals and send feedback
  - Modified snooze functionality to use persistence service
  - Initialize dismissed/snoozed alerts from persistent storage on mount
  - Added proper cleanup and expiration handling

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Dismissal Functionality
- Alerts can be dismissed with optional reason
- Dismissals can be permanent or temporary (24-hour default)
- Dismissals persist across page refreshes
- Feedback sent to CDS service when dismissing

#### Snooze Functionality
- Configurable snooze durations (15 min to 24 hours)
- Snoozed alerts automatically reappear after expiration
- Visual indication of snoozed alert count
- Snooze state persists across sessions

#### User Experience Improvements
- Dismiss button (X) visible on all inline alerts
- Snooze button (clock icon) for non-critical alerts
- Snooze dialog with duration selector
- Override dialog for critical alerts requiring reason

## Technical Implementation Details

### Storage Structure
```javascript
// Dismissed alerts
localStorage['cds-alerts-dismissed-{patientId}'] = [
  {
    alertId: "service-alert-summary",
    reason: "Not applicable to patient",
    dismissedAt: 1706023200000,
    permanent: false,
    expiresAt: 1706109600000  // 24 hours later
  }
]

// Snoozed alerts
localStorage['cds-alerts-snoozed-{patientId}'] = [
  {
    alertId: "service-alert-summary",
    snoozedAt: 1706023200000,
    snoozeUntil: 1706026800000  // 1 hour later
  }
]
```

### Integration Points
1. **CDSPresentation Component**: Main UI component handling alert display
2. **CDSFeedbackService**: Sends dismissal/snooze feedback to CDS service
3. **ClinicalWorkspaceEnhanced**: Displays inline CDS alerts with dismissal capability

## Testing & Validation

### How to Test
1. Navigate to a patient's clinical workspace
2. Trigger CDS alerts (e.g., prescribe medication with interactions)
3. Click the X button to dismiss an alert - it should disappear
4. Refresh the page - dismissed alerts should remain hidden
5. Click snooze button, select duration - alert should hide
6. Wait for snooze duration or manually check after time passes - alert should reappear

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Dismissed alerts remain hidden across page refreshes
- ✅ Snoozed alerts reappear after the specified duration
- ✅ Critical alerts require override reason before dismissal
- ✅ Feedback is sent to CDS service for tracking
- ✅ Patient-specific dismissals (alerts for one patient don't affect another)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Controls**
   - View dismissal history per patient
   - Override dismissals for critical safety alerts
   - Analytics on dismissal patterns

2. **User Preferences**
   - Default snooze duration preferences
   - Alert filtering preferences
   - Dismissal expiration customization

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Complete dismissal history with reasons
   - Integration with audit logging system
   - Compliance reporting capabilities

## Notes
- Uses localStorage for persistence (survives browser refresh but not cache clear)
- Dismissals are patient-specific to maintain clinical context
- Non-permanent dismissals expire after 24 hours by default
- Critical alerts require override reason for compliance
