# Care Gaps Module

## Overview
The Care Gaps module provides care gap analysis and management capabilities, identifying missing or overdue preventive care services and enabling proactive patient outreach for quality improvement.

## Location
- **Component**: `/frontend/src/pages/CareGapsPage.js`
- **Route**: `/care-gaps`
- **Status**: Demonstration Implementation (Mock Data)

## Purpose
This module addresses care quality optimization:
- **Gap Identification**: Find missing preventive services
- **Priority Management**: Focus on high-risk patients
- **Outreach Coordination**: Facilitate patient communication
- **Quality Improvement**: Close care gaps systematically

## Features

### 1. Care Gap Display
- **Patient-Level Gaps**: Individual care deficiencies
- **Gap Details**: Type, due date, last completion
- **Priority Indicators**: Risk-based prioritization
- **Action Buttons**: Direct scheduling capability

### 2. Gap Categories
Demonstration gaps include:
- **Preventive Screenings**: Mammography, colonoscopy
- **Chronic Disease Monitoring**: Diabetic eye exams, A1C tests
- **Health Maintenance**: Blood pressure checks, wellness visits
- **Immunizations**: Flu shots, pneumonia vaccines
- **Follow-up Care**: Post-discharge visits

### 3. Priority Classification
- **High Priority**: Critical overdue items (red)
- **Medium Priority**: Important but not critical (yellow)
- **Low Priority**: Routine maintenance (blue)

### 4. Management Tools
- **Create Action Plan**: Systematic gap closure
- **Send Reminders**: Patient notifications
- **Schedule Appointments**: Direct booking
- **Track Progress**: Monitor closure rates

## User Interface

### Layout Structure
