## Integration Points

### Services Used
- **FHIR Client**: Fetch MedicationRequest resources
- **Pharmacy Service**: Status updates and dispensing
- **Clinical Workflow Context**: Cross-module notifications

### Event Publishing
- `WORKFLOW_NOTIFICATION`: Status changes
- `MEDICATION_DISPENSED`: Completion notifications

### Event Subscriptions
- `ORDER_PLACED`: New prescriptions from clinical workspace

### Data Flow
1. MedicationRequest created in Clinical Workspace
2. Appears in pharmacy queue as "New Order"
3. Pharmacist verifies and moves to "Verification"
4. Medication prepared, status to "Dispensing"
5. Ready for pickup, status to "Ready"
6. MedicationDispense resource created on completion
