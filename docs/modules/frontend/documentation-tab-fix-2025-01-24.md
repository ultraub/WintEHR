# Documentation Tab Fix - 2025-01-24

## Issue
The Documentation tab in Clinical Workspace was throwing a React error:
```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred at line 999 in DocumentationTabEnhanced.js where the code was trying to use:
```javascript
<ClinicalLoadingState.SummaryCards count={4} />
```

However, the actual property exported from ClinicalLoadingState.js is `SummaryCard` (singular), not `SummaryCards` (plural).

## Solution
1. Changed `ClinicalLoadingState.SummaryCards` to `ClinicalLoadingState.SummaryCard` on line 999
2. Added proper Grid container wrapping for the loading state components
3. Created test suite to verify the fix

## Changes Made
- `/frontend/src/components/clinical/workspace/tabs/DocumentationTabEnhanced.js`: Fixed incorrect property name and added Grid wrapper
- `/frontend/src/components/clinical/workspace/tabs/__tests__/DocumentationTabEnhanced.test.js`: Added test suite to prevent regression

## Testing
The fix has been tested with:
- Loading state rendering without errors
- Proper transition from loading to loaded state
- Component render without throwing undefined errors

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always verify imported component property names match their exports
2. Use TypeScript or PropTypes for better type checking
3. Add unit tests for loading states
4. Follow the naming conventions documented in ClinicalLoadingState.js

## Related Components

- `SummaryCard` - For summary card skeletons (NOT SummaryCards)
