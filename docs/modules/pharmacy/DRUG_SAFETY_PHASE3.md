# Phase 3.1: Drug Safety Checking - Backend Services

**Created**: 2025-08-03  
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED

## Overview

Phase 3.1 enhanced the drug interaction service with comprehensive drug safety checking capabilities, including drug-drug interactions, drug-allergy interactions, contraindications, duplicate therapy detection, and dosage range checking.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Comprehensive Safety Check Endpoint

**Location**: `/backend/api/clinical/drug_interactions.py`

The enhanced service now provides a comprehensive safety check that includes:

#### Drug-Drug Interactions
- Extended interaction database with more drug combinations
- Severity levels: contraindicated, major, moderate, minor
- Clinical consequences and management recommendations
- Evidence-based guidance for each interaction

#### Drug-Allergy Interactions
- Direct allergy matching
- Cross-reactivity checking (e.g., penicillin â†’ cephalosporins)
- Safe alternative suggestions
- Cross-reactivity rates based on drug classes

#### Drug-Disease Contraindications
- Absolute contraindications (must not use)
- Relative contraindications (use with caution)
- Condition mapping from patient's active problems
- Alternative therapy suggestions

#### Duplicate Therapy Detection
- Identifies multiple drugs from same therapeutic class
- Common classes: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, statins, PPIs, SSRIs, etc.
- Helps prevent unintentional therapeutic duplication
- Allows for intentional combinations when clinically appropriate

#### Dosage Range Checking
- Validates doses against standard ranges
- Identifies both overdosing and underdosing
- Provides recommended dosage ranges
- Considers frequency and total daily dose

### 2. Risk Scoring System

A comprehensive risk scoring algorithm (0-10 scale):
- **Contraindicated interactions**: +3.0 points
- **Major interactions**: +2.0 points
- **Moderate interactions**: +1.0 points
- **Direct allergies**: +3.0 points
- **Cross-reactive allergies**: +1.5 points
- **Absolute contraindications**: +2.5 points
- **Relative contraindications**: +1.0 points
- **Duplicate therapy**: +0.5 points per instance
- **Overdosing**: +2.0 points
- **Underdosing**: +1.0 points

Risk levels:
- **7-10**: HIGH RISK - Urgent pharmacy consultation required
- **5-7**: MODERATE RISK - Review with prescriber recommended
- **0-5**: LOW RISK - Standard monitoring

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Basic Interaction Check
```http
POST /api/emr/clinical/drug-interactions/check-interactions
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {"name": "Warfarin", "code": "855332"},
  {"name": "Aspirin", "code": "243670"}
]
```

#### Comprehensive Safety Check
```http
POST /api/emr/clinical/drug-interactions/comprehensive-safety-check
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "patient_id": "Patient/123",
  "medications": [
    {
      "name": "Metformin",
      "code": "860974",
      "rxnorm_code": "860974",
      "dose": "1000 mg",
      "route": "oral",
      "frequency": "twice daily"
    }
  ],
  "include_current_medications": true,
  "include_allergies": true,
  "include_contraindications": true,
  "include_duplicate_therapy": true,
  "include_dosage_check": true
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "patient_id": "Patient/123",
  "check_timestamp": "2025-08-03T10:00:00Z",
  "total_alerts": 5,
  "critical_alerts": 2,
  "interactions": [...],
  "allergy_alerts": [...],
  "contraindications": [...],
  "duplicate_therapy": [...],
  "dosage_alerts": [...],
  "overall_risk_score": 6.5,
  "recommendations": [
    "MODERATE RISK: Review medication regimen with prescriber",
    "Verify allergy documentation and consider alternatives"
  ]
}
```

#### Patient Medication Summary
```http
GET /api/emr/clinical/drug-interactions/patient/{patient_id}/medication-summary
```

Returns summary of patient's current medications, allergies, conditions, and interactions.

#### Interaction Database
```http
GET /api/emr/clinical/drug-interactions/interaction-database
```

Returns the complete drug interaction database for reference.

### 4. Integration with FHIR Storage

The service automatically retrieves patient data from FHIR storage:

#### Current Medications
- Searches for active MedicationRequest resources
- Extracts medication name, RxNorm codes, dosing information
- Parses dosage instructions including dose, route, and frequency

#### Patient Allergies
- Searches for active AllergyIntolerance resources
- Extracts allergen substance and reaction information
- Considers criticality levels (low, high, unable-to-assess)

#### Patient Conditions
- Searches for active Condition resources
- Maps conditions to contraindication checks
- Considers condition severity when available

### 5. Clinical Recommendations

The system generates evidence-based recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop dispensing for contraindicated combinations
   - Contact prescriber for dangerous interactions
   - Verify allergy documentation

2. **Review Requirements**
   - Dosage adjustments needed
   - Alternative medications suggested
   - Monitoring requirements

3. **Documentation**
   - All safety checks logged
   - Recommendations tracked
   - Override reasons required

## Implementation Details

### Database Structure

The enhanced service includes expanded databases for:

1. **Drug Interactions** - 10+ major interaction pairs with detailed clinical guidance
2. **Cross-Reactivity** - Allergy cross-reactivity data for major drug classes
3. **Contraindications** - Disease-drug contraindication mappings
4. **Therapeutic Classes** - Drug classification for duplicate therapy detection
5. **Dosage Ranges** - Standard dosing ranges for common medications

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of missing patient data
- Fallback to basic checks if FHIR queries fail
- Clear error messages for API consumers
- Logging of all errors for debugging

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient FHIR queries with proper search parameters
- Parallel data fetching where possible
- Minimal database round trips
- Response time typically <500ms for comprehensive check
