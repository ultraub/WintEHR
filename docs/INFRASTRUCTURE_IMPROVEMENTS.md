  - `clinical_rules.py` - Pre-defined clinical rules library
  - `data_adapters.py` - FHIR to rules engine data conversion
  - `integration.py` - Integration with existing CDS services
- `/backend/api/cds_hooks/cds_hooks_router.py` (updated)

**Description**:
Implemented a comprehensive, flexible rules engine for clinical decision support that integrates with the existing CDS Hooks infrastructure.

**Key Features**:
- Rule-based evaluation with conditions and actions
- 10 rule categories (medication safety, chronic disease, preventive care, etc.)
- 11 pre-defined clinical rules
- Priority-based execution (critical → info)
- FHIR-native data adaptation
- Legacy service integration
- Management endpoints for statistics and rule toggling
- Parallel rule evaluation for performance

**Clinical Rules Implemented**:
1. **Medication Safety**:
   - Warfarin-NSAID interaction alerts
   - Metformin renal dosing checks
   - Duplicate therapy detection

2. **Chronic Disease Management**:
   - Diabetes A1C monitoring reminders
   - Hypertension BP goal alerts
   - Diabetic eye exam reminders

3. **Preventive Care**:
   - Annual flu vaccine reminders
   - Mammogram screening (women 50-74)

4. **Lab Monitoring**:
   - Statin liver function monitoring
   - Warfarin INR monitoring

**Integration**:
- Seamless integration with existing CDS Hooks
- New v2 service endpoints with rules engine support
- Option to run legacy services alongside new rules
- RESTful management API

## Implementation Details

### Database Optimization Script

The optimization script creates indexes based on common query patterns identified through analysis:

```sql
-- Example: Patient reference index
CREATE INDEX idx_resources_patient_ref ON fhir.resources 
USING gin ((resource->'subject')) 
WHERE resource_type IN ('Condition', 'Observation', 'MedicationRequest');
```

### WebSocket Connection Pool Architecture

```
Client → WebSocket → Connection Pool → Rate Limiter → Room Manager → Broadcast
                            ↓
                     Metrics Tracker → Monitoring API
```

### Validation Cache Flow

```
Resource → Generate Cache Key → Check Cache → Hit: Return Result
                                      ↓
                                    Miss: Validate → Store in Cache → Return Result
```

### CDS Rules Engine Flow

```
CDS Hook Request → Data Adapter → Rules Engine → Evaluate Conditions → Execute Actions → CDS Response
                                        ↓
                                 Legacy Services (optional merge)
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Database Indexes
- Run `optimize_database_indexes.py` periodically to analyze index usage
- Remove unused indexes identified by the script
- Monitor slow query logs for new patterns

### WebSocket Connections
- Monitor via `/api/websocket/metrics` endpoint
- Alert on high connection counts or rate limit violations
- Adjust pool size based on usage patterns

### Validation Cache
- Monitor cache hit rate and efficiency
- Adjust TTL based on resource volatility
- Clear cache after major data imports

### CDS Rules Engine
- Monitor rule execution statistics via `/cds-hooks/rules-engine/statistics`
- Review rule effectiveness through outcome tracking
- Add custom rules as clinical needs evolve

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Authentication System (JWT, RBAC)** - Secure multi-tenant access
2. **Database Migrations (Alembic)** - Version-controlled schema changes
3. **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive FHIR operation tracking
4. **FHIR Subscriptions** - Real-time resource change notifications
5. **Data Export (CDA, CSV)** - Interoperability and reporting
6. **Monitoring (OpenTelemetry)** - Distributed tracing and metrics

### CDS Rules Engine Roadmap
1. Machine learning integration for predictive alerts
2. Natural language rule definitions
3. Rule versioning and change tracking
4. Outcome-based rule effectiveness monitoring
5. External rule source integration
