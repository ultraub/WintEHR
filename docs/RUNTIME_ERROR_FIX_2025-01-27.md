# Runtime Error Fix - January 27, 2025

## Issue: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')

### Problem Description
When trying to add a new condition in the clinical workspace within the chart review tab, a runtime error occurred:
```
Uncaught runtime errors:
ERROR
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The error was occurring in two places:

1. **FHIRResourceContext.js** - The reducer was trying to access `resource.id` without checking if the resource was defined
2. **ChartReviewTabOptimized.js** - The `addResource` function was being called with incorrect parameters

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Added null checks in FHIRResourceContext.js
Updated the reducer to check if resources exist before accessing their properties:

```javascript
// Before
resources.forEach(resource => {
  resourceMap[resource.id] = resource;
});

// After  
resources.forEach(resource => {
  if (resource && resource.id) {
    resourceMap[resource.id] = resource;
  }
});
```

Also added validation in the ADD_RESOURCE case:
```javascript
case FHIR_ACTIONS.ADD_RESOURCE: {
  const { resourceType, resource } = action.payload;
  
  // Validate resource exists and has an id
  if (!resource || !resource.id) {
    console.error('ADD_RESOURCE: Resource is missing or has no id', { resourceType, resource });
    return state;
  }
  
  // ... rest of the logic
}
```

#### 2. Fixed incorrect addResource call in ChartReviewTabOptimized.js
The `addResource` function expects two parameters (resourceType and resource), but was being called with only one:

```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
addResource(result);

// After (correct)
addResource(resource.resourceType, result);
```

### Testing
After these fixes:
1. Adding new conditions should work without errors
2. The resource should be properly added to the FHIRResourceContext
3. The UI should update to show the new condition

- `/frontend/src/components/clinical/workspace/tabs/ChartReviewTabOptimized.js`

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding TypeScript to catch these parameter mismatches at compile time
- Add unit tests for the reducer to ensure it handles undefined resources gracefully
- Consider adding PropTypes or better documentation for context functions
