# CDS Modal Display Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Author**: AI Assistant

## Problem
CDS hooks configured with modal presentation were not displaying as modals in the clinical workspace. Instead, they were always showing as inline alerts.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Hardcoded Presentation Mode**: The ClinicalWorkspaceEnhanced component was hardcoding all CDS alerts to use INLINE presentation mode
2. **Missing Mode Mapping**: The CDSContext mode mapping didn't include 'modal' as a direct mapping (only 'hard-stop' â†’ MODAL)
3. **Display Behavior Not Propagated**: The display behavior configuration from CDS hooks wasn't being properly used in the presentation layer

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CDSContext.js
- Added 'modal' to the presentation mode mapping
- Added 'banner' and 'toast' modes for completeness
- Mode mapping now includes:
  ```javascript
  const modeMapping = {
    'hard-stop': PRESENTATION_MODES.MODAL,
    'modal': PRESENTATION_MODES.MODAL,
    'popup': PRESENTATION_MODES.POPUP,
    'sidebar': PRESENTATION_MODES.SIDEBAR,
    'inline': PRESENTATION_MODES.INLINE,
    'banner': PRESENTATION_MODES.BANNER,
    'toast': PRESENTATION_MODES.TOAST
  };
  ```

### 2. Updated ClinicalWorkspaceEnhanced.js
- Removed hardcoded INLINE mode
- Now groups alerts by their configured presentation mode
- Each group is rendered with the appropriate CDSPresentation mode
- Implementation:
  ```javascript
  const alertsByMode = cdsAlerts.reduce((acc, alert) => {
    const mode = alert.displayBehavior?.presentationMode || PRESENTATION_MODES.INLINE;
    if (!acc[mode]) acc[mode] = [];
    acc[mode].push(alert);
    return acc;
  }, {});
  ```

### 3. Enhanced DisplayBehaviorConfig.js
- Updated to support all presentation modes
- Added severity-based overrides UI
- Improved configuration preview
- Added descriptive text for each presentation mode

### 4. Created DisplayBehaviorConfiguration.js (New)
- Comprehensive display behavior configuration component
- Supports all CDS Hooks display options
- Includes acknowledgment and snooze settings
- Better UI/UX for configuration

## Testing

### Test Hook Created
Created `TestModalCDSHook.js` with a critical drug interaction alert that:
- Shows as modal for critical severity
- Requires acknowledgment
- Cannot be snoozed
- Triggers for patients over 65

### Test Script
Created `createTestModalHook.js` that provides:
- `createTestModalHook()` - Creates/updates the test hook
- `deleteTestModalHook()` - Removes the test hook
- Available in browser console as global functions

## How to Test

1. **Create the test hook**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   window.createTestModalHook()
   ```

2. **Navigate to a patient over 65 years old**

3. **Verify modal behavior**:
   - Modal dialog appears blocking the UI
   - Cannot be closed by clicking outside
   - ESC key is disabled
   - Requires "Acknowledge & Continue" button click
   - If configured, requires override reason

4. **Clean up**:
   ```javascript
   window.deleteTestModalHook()
   ```

## Configuration Examples

### Modal Alert (Hard-stop)
```javascript
displayBehavior: {
  defaultMode: 'popup',
  indicatorOverrides: {
    critical: 'modal',  // Critical alerts show as modal
    warning: 'popup',
    info: 'inline'
  },
  acknowledgment: {
    required: true,
    reasonRequired: true
  }
}
```

### Mixed Presentation
```javascript
displayBehavior: {
  defaultMode: 'inline',
  indicatorOverrides: {
    critical: 'modal',    // Blocking
    warning: 'banner',    // Top of page
    info: 'toast'        // Temporary notification
  }
}
```

## Additional Notes

- The CDSPresentation component already had proper modal implementation
- Modal alerts properly require acknowledgment before dismissal
- Override reasons can be configured and are properly handled
- Persistence of dismissals and snoozes is maintained
- Multiple presentation modes can be active simultaneously
