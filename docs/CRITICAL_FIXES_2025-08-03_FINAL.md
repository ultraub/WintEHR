   - Lot management with expiration tracking
   - Low stock and expiration alerts
   - Receive shipment functionality
   - Inventory reports generation

### Files Created/Modified

#### Security Infrastructure
- `/backend/migrations/add_auth_users_table.sql` - Auth database schema
- `/backend/api/auth/secure_auth_service.py` - Secure authentication service
- `/backend/api/middleware/security_middleware.py` - HTTPS and security headers
- `/frontend/src/services/websocket.js` - WebSocket service implementation
- `/frontend/src/components/common/WebSocketStatus.js` - Connection indicator

#### Pharmacy Features
- `/frontend/src/services/prescriptionLabelService.js` - Label printing service
- `/frontend/src/services/inventoryManagementService.js` - Inventory management
- `/frontend/src/pages/InventoryManagementPage.js` - Inventory UI
- Updated `/frontend/src/components/pharmacy/PharmacyQueue.js` - Added print/inventory
- Updated `/frontend/src/pages/PharmacyPage.js` - Added batch print dialog

#### Documentation
- `/docs/SECURE_AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md` - Auth system documentation
- `/docs/HTTPS_ENFORCEMENT_GUIDE.md` - HTTPS setup guide
- `/docs/PHARMACY_PRINT_LABELS_GUIDE.md` - Label printing guide
- `/docs/INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Inventory system guide

## Remaining Tasks (Low Priority)

Only one task remains incomplete:

**Complete audit logging for all FHIR operations**
- Currently only authentication events are logged
- Need to add audit trails for:
  - All FHIR resource CRUD operations
  - Patient data access
  - Clinical decision modifications
  - Prescription dispensing
  - Inventory changes

## Security Improvements Summary

1. **Authentication**: Moved from hardcoded passwords to secure database system
2. **Authorization**: Implemented RBAC with controlled substance permissions
3. **Transport**: HTTPS enforcement with security headers
4. **Monitoring**: Added security event logging and attack detection
5. **Client Security**: WebSocket with authentication and auto-reconnection

## Functionality Improvements Summary

1. **Pharmacy Workflow**: Complete dispensing with print labels
2. **Inventory Control**: Real-time stock management with alerts
3. **User Experience**: Visual indicators for system status
4. **Compliance**: DEA controlled substance tracking
5. **Reporting**: Inventory and prescription reports

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Run Auth Migration**:
   ```bash
   docker exec emr-backend python scripts/setup_secure_auth.py
   ```

2. **Enable Security Features**:
   ```bash
   export JWT_ENABLED=true
   export USE_SECURE_AUTH=true
   export ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

3. **Test Features**:
   - Print prescription labels
   - Check inventory levels
   - Manage stock shipments
   - Monitor WebSocket connection

## Critical Notes

- **Production Deployment**: Must run auth migration before production use
- **Default Passwords**: Change all default passwords immediately
- **HTTPS Required**: Never run production without HTTPS
- **Inventory Data**: Currently using mock data, integrate with real system
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit logging before HIPAA certification
