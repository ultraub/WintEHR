# ImagingTab Runtime Error Fix

## Issue

The ImagingTab component was throwing a runtime error:
```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

## Root Cause

The shared components index file (`/frontend/src/components/clinical/shared/index.js`) was using ES6 directory imports without explicit file extensions:

```javascript
// This was causing directory import errors
export * from './cards';
export * from './dialogs';
// etc.
```

This syntax is not supported in ES modules when running in Node.js environments, causing the exports to fail and resulting in undefined components.

## Solution

Updated all directory imports in the shared index file to include explicit file paths:

```javascript
// Fixed by adding explicit file paths
export * from './cards/index.js';
export * from './dialogs/index.js';
export * from './tables/index.js';
export * from './inputs/index.js';
export * from './display/index.js';
export * from './layout/index.js';
export * from './templates/index.js';
```

## Files Modified

- `/frontend/src/components/clinical/shared/index.js` - Added explicit `.js` extensions to all export statements

## Verification

After the fix:
1. The compilation errors were resolved
2. The runtime error disappeared
3. The app loads successfully
4. Only harmless warnings about unused imports remain

## Impact

This fix ensures that all shared clinical components are properly exported and can be imported by other components like ImagingTab. The explicit file paths make the imports compatible with both webpack bundling and ES module resolution.
