# Encounter Summary Enhancement - January 27, 2025

## Overview

The Encounter Summary dialog has been completely redesigned to better utilize available FHIR data and provide a more comprehensive, user-friendly view of encounter information.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced FHIR Data Utilization

The new summary now displays comprehensive FHIR data that was previously hidden:

- **Complete Participant Information**: Shows all care team members with their roles (attending, primary performer, consultant, etc.)
- **Service Provider**: Displays the organization providing care
- **Location Details**: Shows where the encounter took place
- **Hospitalization Information**: 
  - Admission source and discharge disposition
  - Diet preferences and special arrangements
  - Pre-admission identifiers
- **Encounter Progression**: Visual timeline of class history changes
- **Priority Indicators**: Shows encounter priority with visual warnings for urgent cases
- **Appointment References**: Links to related appointments
- **Comprehensive Diagnoses**: Shows admission vs working diagnoses with ranking

### 2. Modern UI Design

#### Tabbed Interface
- **Overview Tab**: Main encounter information and quick stats
- **Timeline Tab**: Visual timeline of all encounter events
- **Labs Tab**: Lab results with critical value highlighting
- **Medications Tab**: Active medications with dosage and route
- **Notes Tab**: Clinical documentation with signing status

#### Visual Enhancements
- **Header with Metrics**: Quick view of diagnoses, active meds, critical findings
- **Status Indicators**: Visual icons for encounter status
- **Color-Coded Elements**: Using theme colors for different types of information
- **Responsive Design**: Full mobile support with adaptive layouts

#### Quick Stats Panel
- Clickable cards showing counts for each resource type

### 3. Theme Integration

All hardcoded colors have been replaced with theme-aware colors:
- Uses `alpha()` for transparent overlays
- Respects light/dark mode preferences
- Consistent with application's design system
- Proper contrast ratios for accessibility

### 4. Enhanced Functionality

#### Quick Actions
- Add Clinical Note button
- Place Order button
- View Full Timeline navigation
- Direct links to related clinical modules

#### Better Navigation
- Clicking on resource counts navigates to that tab
- Links to navigate to specific clinical modules
- Breadcrumb support for context

#### Export & Print

- Multiple export formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- Includes related resources in exports

### 5. Real-time Integration

- Publishes events through ClinicalWorkflowContext
- Responds to real-time updates
- Integrates with other clinical modules
