# Theme System Improvements - January 27, 2025

## Overview

Significant improvements were made to the WintEHR theme system to broaden color schemes and ensure proper theme usage across components.

## 1. Expanded Color Schemes

Added 6 new theme presets to complement the existing 4 themes:

### New Themes Added:
1. **Ocean Health** - Calming blues and teals for therapeutic environments
2. **Forest Wellness** - Natural greens promoting healing and wellness  
3. **Sunrise Care** - Warm oranges and yellows for optimistic healthcare
4. **Midnight Shift** - Ultra-dark theme for night shift workers
5. **Monochrome Clinical** - Grayscale theme for minimal color distraction
6. **Pediatric Friendly** - Bright, cheerful colors for pediatric departments

### Implementation Details:
- Added complete color palettes for each theme in `medicalTheme.js`
- Implemented both light and dark mode variants for all themes
- Updated `ThemeSwitcher.js` with preview styles for new themes
- All themes include proper clinical severity colors and semantic tokens

## 2. Theme Persistence

The theme system already had proper persistence implemented using localStorage for:
- Theme selection (`medicalTheme`)
- Light/Dark mode (`medicalMode`)
- Department selection (`medicalDepartment`)
- Auto-detect context (`autoDetectClinicalContext`)

## 3. Component Updates for Theme Compliance

### Components Fixed:

#### VitalSignsTrends.js
- **Before**: Hardcoded colors like `#ff4444`, `#4444ff`, `#ccc`
- **After**: Uses theme colors like `theme.palette.error.main`, `theme.palette.primary.main`, `theme.palette.divider`
- Added `useTheme` hook for theme access

#### PharmacyQueue.js
- **Before**: Hardcoded background colors like `#ffebee`, `#fff3e0`
- **After**: Uses `alpha(theme.palette[priorityInfo.color]?.main, 0.08)` for dynamic theme-based transparency
- Removed hardcoded `bgColor` properties from PRIORITY_LEVELS

#### SearchBar.js
- **Before**: Used `alpha('#000', 0.02)` for background colors
- **After**: Uses `alpha(theme.palette.action.hover, 0.5)` and `theme.palette.action.hover`
- Added `useTheme` hook for theme access

## 4. Remaining Work

### Components Still Using Hardcoded Colors:
Several components were identified that still use hardcoded colors:
- `theme/ThemeSwitcher.js` - Department colors are hardcoded
- `cds-studio/shared/CDSLoadingStates.js`
- `clinical/pharmacy/MedicationAdministrationRecord.js`
- Multiple components in `clinical/workspace/tabs/`
- FHIR Explorer v4 components

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Complete audit of all remaining components with hardcoded colors
2. Update department colors in ThemeSwitcher to use theme variables
3. Test all themes across different modules to ensure consistency
4. Consider adding theme preview functionality to help users choose themes
5. Document theme usage guidelines for future development

## Technical Notes

### Theme Color Usage Best Practices:
1. Always use `useTheme()` hook to access theme colors
2. Use `alpha()` for transparency instead of hardcoded rgba values
3. Prefer semantic color tokens (e.g., `theme.palette.error.main`) over specific colors
4. Use theme severity colors for clinical indicators
5. Leverage theme divider color for borders and separators

### Example Pattern:
```javascript
import { useTheme, alpha } from '@mui/material/styles';

const Component = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <Box sx={{
      backgroundColor: alpha(theme.palette.primary.main, 0.1),
      borderColor: theme.palette.divider,
      color: theme.palette.text.primary
    }}>
      Content
    </Box>
  );
};
```

## Summary

The theme system has been significantly enhanced with 6 new color schemes, bringing the total to 10 themes. Three key components have been updated to use theme variables instead of hardcoded colors, establishing patterns for updating the remaining components. The theme persistence system was already well-implemented and continues to work properly with the new themes.
