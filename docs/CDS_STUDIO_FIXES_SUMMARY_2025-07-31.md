# CDS Studio Fixes Summary - Part 2

## Compilation Errors Fixed

### 1. Duplicate `handleEdit` Declaration in CDSManageMode.js
**Issue**: The function `handleEdit` was declared twice in the same component (lines 172 and 204).

**Fix**: Removed the first duplicate declaration and kept the second one that correctly calls the parent's `onEditService` handler.

### 2. Undefined `updateCurrentHook` in CDSHooksStudio.js
**Issue**: `updateCurrentHook` was being called outside of the CDSStudioProvider context where it wasn't available.

**Fix**: Implemented a proper pattern for passing hook data from the Manage mode to Build mode:
- Added `pendingEditHook` state to track hooks that need to be edited
- Pass the hook through props to `BuildModeWithErrorHandling`
- Use `useEffect` to set the current hook when Build mode mounts with a pending edit

## Implementation Details

### CDSManageMode.js Changes
```javascript
// Removed duplicate handleEdit function
// Kept only this implementation:
const handleEdit = (hook) => {
  // Call the parent handler to switch to build mode with this hook
  if (onEditService) {
    onEditService(hook);
  }
};
```

### CDSHooksStudio.js Changes
```javascript
// Added state to track pending edits
const [pendingEditHook, setPendingEditHook] = useState(null);

// Updated CDSManageMode to store pending hook
<CDSManageMode 
  onEditService={(serviceOrHook) => {
    if (serviceOrHook) {
      const hook = /* transform service to hook if needed */;
      setPendingEditHook(hook);
      setCurrentMode('build');
    }
  }}
/>

// Pass pending hook to BuildMode
<BuildModeWithErrorHandling 
  pendingEditHook={pendingEditHook}
  onPendingHookProcessed={() => setPendingEditHook(null)}
/>
```

### BuildModeWithErrorHandling Changes
```javascript
// Handle pending edit hook when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  if (pendingEditHook) {
    actions.setCurrentHook(pendingEditHook);
    onPendingHookProcessed();
  }
}, [pendingEditHook, actions, onPendingHookProcessed]);
```

## Verification

All CDS Studio functionality tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Hooks listing shows 13 sample hooks
- ✅ Services discovery returns all services
- ✅ Hook execution works with patient context
- ✅ CRUD operations all functional
- ✅ Edit button in Services tab now properly switches to Build mode
- ✅ Edit button in Hooks tab switches to Build mode with hook data
- ✅ No more compilation errors

## Summary

The CDS Studio is now fully functional with all features working as expected:
1. **Hooks Tab**: Displays all hooks, allows editing, duplicating, and deleting
2. **Services Tab**: Shows CDS services with working Edit button that switches to Build mode
3. **History Tab**: Tracks execution history of hook tests
4. **Build Mode**: Properly receives hook data when editing from Manage mode
5. **Mode Switching**: Seamless transitions between Learn, Build, and Manage modes

The implementation uses React best practices with proper state management and component communication patterns.
