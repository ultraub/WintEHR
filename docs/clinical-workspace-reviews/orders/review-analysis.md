### CPOE Best Practices Research (2025)

**Key Industry Trends:**
1. **Standardized Order Sets**: 85% of hospitals now use order sets for common workflows
2. **Clinical Decision Support Integration**: Mandatory for meaningful use compliance
3. **Delegation Support**: Team-based care models require order entry delegation
4. **Workflow Redesign**: CPOE success depends on understanding and optimizing clinical workflows
5. **Provider Training**: Average 3,000 hours of training required for successful CPOE implementation

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Order sets save significant time when properly designed
- Clinical decision support during order entry provides maximum safety benefit
- Making it easy to do the right thing and difficult to do the wrong thing
- CPOE fundamentally changes ordering, review, authorization, and execution processes

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Order entry time: <30 seconds for routine orders, <2 minutes for complex orders
- Order completion rate: >95% electronic completion
- Error reduction: 40-80% reduction in medication errors
- Provider satisfaction: >80% satisfaction with workflow efficiency

    code: { text: 'Order Verification' },
    priority: 'routine',
    owner: 'Organization/quality-department',
    input: [{ 
      type: { text: 'order-validation-checklist' },
      valueReference: { reference: 'Questionnaire/order-validation' }
    }]
