  prescription: {
    resourceType: 'MedicationRequest',
    status: 'active',
    intent: 'order'
  },
  dispense: {
    resourceType: 'MedicationDispense', // NEW RESOURCE
    status: 'completed',
    authorizingPrescription: [{ reference: 'MedicationRequest/123' }]
  },
  administration: {
    resourceType: 'MedicationAdministration', // NEW RESOURCE
    status: 'completed',
    request: { reference: 'MedicationRequest/123' },
    partOf: { reference: 'MedicationDispense/456' }
  }
};
```
