- **1 duplicate context file** (unused, 863 lines)
- **6 root-level test scripts** (one-off utilities, ~30 KB)
- **10 debug/test utilities** in frontend/src/test (~48 KB)
- **36 Python cache directories** (~80 KB)
- **11 historical documentation files** (~500 KB)
- Multiple test harnesses that may be obsolete

**Potential Total Cleanup**: ~650 KB code + documentation

---

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Safe to Remove Immediately

### 1. Duplicate Context File (863 lines, ~25 KB)
```
❌ frontend/src/core/fhir/contexts/FHIRResourceContext.js
   - Status: UNUSED (0 imports found)
   - Duplicate of: frontend/src/contexts/FHIRResourceContext.js (1,848 lines, 57 imports)
   - Reason: The main version in contexts/ is actively used by AppProviders and 57+ components
   - Impact: ZERO - No code imports this file
   - Recommendation: DELETE IMMEDIATELY
```

**Action**:
```bash
rm frontend/src/core/fhir/contexts/FHIRResourceContext.js
```

### 2. Python Cache Directories (36 directories, ~80 KB)
```
❌ All __pycache__ directories
   - backend/__pycache__/ (8 KB)
   - backend/models/__pycache__/ (40 KB)
   - backend/clinical_canvas/__pycache__/ (32 KB)
   - 33+ other __pycache__ directories
   
   Status: Python bytecode cache files
   Reason: Auto-generated, should be in .gitignore
   Impact: ZERO - Regenerated automatically by Python
   Recommendation: DELETE ALL + Add to .gitignore
```

**Action**:
```bash
# Remove all Python cache
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" ! -path "*/node_modules/*" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -name "*.pyo" -delete

# Add to .gitignore if not already there
echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pyc" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pyo" >> .gitignore
```

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Review Before Removal

### 3. Root-Level Test Scripts (6 files, ~30 KB)
One-off test utilities that appear to be development scripts:

```
📋 test-bug-fixes.js (7.5 KB, Oct 4 2025)
   Purpose: Tests race conditions and memory leaks
   Usage: Standalone test script (not in package.json)
   Recommendation: Move to frontend/tests/integration/ or DELETE if tests are in proper test suite
   
📋 test-all-pages.js (9.5 KB, Jul 30 2025)
   Purpose: Puppeteer tests for all pages and dialogs
   Usage: Standalone E2E test script
   Recommendation: Move to frontend/tests/e2e/ or DELETE if covered by formal E2E tests
   
📋 test-fhir-operations.js (4.0 KB, Jul 30 2025)
   Purpose: FHIR operation testing
   Recommendation: Move to backend/tests/ or DELETE if redundant
   
📋 validate-fhir-client.js (4.3 KB, Jul 30 2025)
   Purpose: FHIR client validation
   Recommendation: Move to frontend/src/__tests__/ or DELETE if redundant
   
📋 validate-fhir-migration.js (4.7 KB, Jul 30 2025)
   Purpose: Migration validation (likely obsolete after completed migration)
   Recommendation: DELETE - Migration from fhirService to fhirClient completed in Jan 2025
   
📋 quick-validate.js (1.9 KB, Jul 30 2025)
   Purpose: Quick validation utility
   Recommendation: Move to scripts/ or DELETE if not used
```

**Decision Matrix**:
- If tests are covered in formal test suites → DELETE
- If tests are unique and valuable → Move to appropriate test directory
- If migration complete → DELETE validate-fhir-migration.js

### 4. Debug/Test Utilities Directory (10 files, ~48 KB)
```
📁 frontend/src/test/
   All files dated Aug 6, 2025 - Appear to be CDS modal testing utilities
   
   Files:
   - CDSOverrideReasonTestPage.js (7.3 KB)
   - createTestModalHook.js (2.1 KB)
   - debugDisplayBehaviorFlow.js (5.0 KB)
   - debugModalSave.js (5.8 KB)
   - loadCDSTests.js (1.7 KB)
   - testCDSModalAcknowledgment.js (4.1 KB)
   - TestModalCDSHook.js (2.8 KB)
   - testModalDisplay.js (4.6 KB)
   - testOverrideReasonSave.js (3.7 KB)
   - TestOverrideScenarios.js (8.1 KB)
   
   Status: Debug utilities for CDS modal testing
   Recommendation: 
   - If CDS modal implementation is complete and tested → DELETE directory
   - If still debugging CDS features → KEEP but document purpose
   - Consider consolidating into formal test suite
```

**Questions to Answer**:
1. Are CDS modals fully implemented and stable?
2. Are these tests duplicated in formal test suite?
3. Are any of these imported/used by the application?

### 5. Historical Documentation (11 files, ~500 KB)
Already identified in Phase 1, now with detailed recommendations:

```
📋 AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md
   Date: Oct 3, 2025
   Decision: Check if this is the CURRENT production deployment
   If YES → Keep as production deployment record
   If NO → Move to docs/archive/deployment/
   
📋 DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
   Content: Documents permanent fixes applied to source code
   Action: Review if information is already in CLAUDE.md
   If YES → DELETE
   If NO → Consolidate into CLAUDE.md, then DELETE
   
📋 DEPLOYMENT_REPORT_wintehr.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com_20251003.md
   Date: Oct 3, 2025
   Decision: Archive for audit trail
   Action: Move to docs/archive/deployment/
   
📋 aws-connection-troubleshooting.md
   Content: AWS-specific troubleshooting (project uses Azure)
   Decision: Is AWS deployment still relevant?
   If NO → DELETE
   If YES → Move to docs/archive/aws/ for historical reference
```

**Test Documentation** (7 files):
```
📋 backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/SEARCH_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md (Jan 20, 2025)
   Content: Search functionality investigation and fixes
   Action: Check if search issues are resolved
   If YES → Move to docs/archive/testing/resolved/
   If NO → Keep until resolved
   
📋 backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/FHIR_TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
   Action: Consolidate into main test documentation
   
📋 backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/TEST_FAILURE_SUMMARY.md
   Action: If tests passing → DELETE
   
📋 backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/FHIR_API_TEST_ANALYSIS.md
   Action: Consolidate into docs/FHIR_API_TEST_SUMMARY.md
   
📋 backend/scripts/testing/FHIR_SEARCH_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
   Action: Information likely in backend/scripts/CLAUDE.md → DELETE
   
📋 backend/scripts/testing/TOKEN_SEARCH_FIX_SUMMARY.md
   Action: Information likely in backend/scripts/CLAUDE.md → DELETE
   
📋 backend/scripts/testing/FHIR_SEARCH_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS.md
   Action: If tests passing consistently → DELETE
```

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Archive Consideration

### 6. Test Harness Suites
```
📁 backend/tests/fhir-implementation-fixes/
   Structure:
   - administrative/ (7 test files)
   - core-clinical/ (8 test files)
   - documentation/ (5 test files)
   - infrastructure/ (4 test files)
   - medication/ (5 test files)
   - provider-organization/ (5 test files)
   - test-harnesses/ (12 validation/benchmark files)
   
   Status: Comprehensive test suites for FHIR implementation
   
   Questions:
   1. Are these tests actively maintained?
   2. Do they pass consistently?
   3. Are they part of CI/CD pipeline?
   4. Are they duplicated in other test directories?
   
   Recommendation:
   - Run pytest to see which tests pass/fail
   - If passing and active → KEEP
   - If failing with no plan to fix → Move to archive
   - If duplicated → Consolidate and remove duplicates
```

### 7. Deprecated Services (Potential)
Based on CLAUDE.md documentation:

```
⚠️  services/fhirService.js
   Status: DEPRECATED - Migration to fhirClient completed Jan 2025
   Check: Search for remaining imports
   If found → Update imports to use fhirClient
   If none → DELETE file
```

**Verification needed**:
```bash
grep -r "from.*fhirService" frontend/src --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" | grep -v test | grep -v node_modules
```

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 2A - Immediate Safe Cleanup (EXECUTE NOW)
```bash
# 1. Remove duplicate FHIRResourceContext
rm frontend/src/core/fhir/contexts/FHIRResourceContext.js

# 2. Remove all Python cache
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" ! -path "*/node_modules/*" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete

# 3. Update .gitignore
cat >> .gitignore << 'GITIGNORE'
# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
GITIGNORE
```

**Space Savings**: ~105 KB  
**Risk**: ZERO

### Phase 2B - Review and Decide (MANUAL REVIEW)
```bash
# 1. Review root-level test scripts
ls -lh *.js | grep test

# Questions:
# - Are these covered by formal test suites?
# - Should any be moved to appropriate test directories?
# - Can validate-fhir-migration.js be deleted (migration complete)?

# 2. Review frontend/src/test/ directory
ls -lh frontend/src/test/

# Questions:
# - Are CDS modals fully implemented and tested?
# - Are these debug utilities still needed?
# - Should they be in formal test suite instead?

# 3. Review historical documentation
# - Check deployment docs against current deployment
# - Consolidate test documentation
# - Archive or delete AWS-specific docs
```

### Phase 2C - Archive Creation (OPTIONAL)
```bash
# Create archive structure
mkdir -p docs/archive/{deployment,testing,aws}

# Move historical documents
mv AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md docs/archive/deployment/ 2>/dev/null
mv DEPLOYMENT_REPORT_*.md docs/archive/deployment/ 2>/dev/null
mv aws-connection-troubleshooting.md docs/archive/aws/ 2>/dev/null

# Move test summaries
mv backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/*_SUMMARY.md docs/archive/testing/ 2>/dev/null
mv backend/scripts/testing/*_SUMMARY.md docs/archive/testing/ 2>/dev/null
```

---

## 🔍 Additional Investigations Needed

### 1. Check for Deprecated fhirService Usage
```bash
grep -r "fhirService" frontend/src --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" \
  | grep -v test | grep -v node_modules | grep -v "fhirClient"
```

### 2. Verify Test Suite Coverage
```bash
# Run backend tests
cd backend && pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Check for consistently failing tests
pytest tests/ --lf  # Last failed

# Check for skipped tests
pytest tests/ -v | grep -i skip
```

### 3. Check for Unused Imports
```bash
# Use ESLint or similar tool to find unused imports
npm run lint -- --fix  # If configured

# Or manually check large files
grep -r "^import.*from" frontend/src --include="*.js" | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

## ⚠️ Risks and Considerations

### LOW RISK (Execute with confidence)
- ✅ Python cache removal
- ✅ Duplicate FHIRResourceContext removal
- ✅ Historical deployment logs (already superseded)

### MEDIUM RISK (Review before action)
- ⚠️  Root-level test scripts (might have unique test cases)
- ⚠️  frontend/src/test/ directory (might be actively used for debugging)
- ⚠️  Test harness consolidation (need to understand coverage)

### HIGH RISK (Requires careful analysis)
- 🚨 Removing test suites without verification
- 🚨 Deleting documentation that might contain unique information
- 🚨 Removing code that might be referenced dynamically
