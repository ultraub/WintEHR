# WebSocket Issue Diagnosis

## Problem
The enhanced clinical workspace shows a loading spinner even though patient data is being fetched successfully. The WebSocket connection remains in a pending state.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. WebSocket Connection Flow
- Frontend tries to connect to `ws://localhost:8000/api/ws`
- Backend has JWT_ENABLED=false (simple auth mode)
- Frontend detects we have an auth token from quickLogin
- Frontend attempts JWT authentication with WebSocket
- Backend expects simple mode connection
- Connection gets stuck in pending state

### 2. UI Blocking
Components may be waiting for:
- WebSocket to be connected before rendering
- Multiple contexts to initialize
- All loading states to be false

## Diagnostic Panel Added
I've added a diagnostic panel to the Enhanced Clinical Layout that shows:
- Auth status
- WebSocket connection status
- Patient data loading status
- FHIR resource loading status

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix WebSocket Connection
The WebSocket context needs to properly handle the case where:
- We have a session token (not JWT)
- Backend is in simple mode
- Connection should proceed without JWT auth

### Option 2: Make UI Not Block on WebSocket
Components should render even if WebSocket is not connected, as it's only needed for real-time updates, not initial data display.

### Option 3: Temporary Workaround
Clear the auth token to force simple mode:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('auth_token');
// Then refresh page
```

## How to View Diagnostics
1. Login using quickLogin() 
2. Navigate to clinical workspace
3. Look for diagnostic panel in bottom right corner
4. It will show real-time status of all systems
