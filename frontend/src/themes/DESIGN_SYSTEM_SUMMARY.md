- Trend visualization
- Department and urgency-based styling

#### **ClinicalCard** (`components/clinical/common/ClinicalCard.js`)
- Flexible card component with clinical context
- Expandable/collapsible functionality
- Severity and urgency visual indicators
- Consistent action toolbar

#### **ClinicalDataTable** (`components/clinical/common/ClinicalDataTable.js`)
- Smart data formatting based on clinical data types
- Severity-based row highlighting
- Trend indicators
- Responsive design

#### **ClinicalLayout** (`components/clinical/layouts/ClinicalLayout.js`)
- Adaptive layout with shift indicators
- Department branding
- Patient context display
- Responsive breakpoints

### 3. **Enhanced Existing Components** ✅

#### **StatusChip** 
- Added department context awareness
- Urgency-based animations
- Improved color mappings for clinical statuses

#### **ThemeSwitcher**
- Added department selection
- Auto-detect clinical context option
- Preview of theme changes
- Accessibility options

### 4. **Clinical Theme Utilities** ✅
Created `clinicalThemeUtils.js` with:
- `getClinicalContext()`: Detects current clinical context
- `applyDepartmentTheme()`: Applies department-specific enhancements
- `applyShiftTheme()`: Adjusts theme for shift conditions
- `generateClinicalPalette()`: Creates context-aware color palettes

### 5. **Integration Completed** ✅

#### **ChartReviewTab**
- Converted ProblemList, MedicationList, and AllergyList to use ClinicalCard
- Added department prop throughout
- Enhanced with clinical context awareness

#### **ClinicalWorkspaceV3**
- Wrapped with ClinicalLayout
- Added department detection
- Passes clinical context to all tabs

#### **PatientSummaryV4**
- Replaced all summary cards with MetricCard
- Added severity and trend indicators
- Context-aware styling

#### **App.js**
- Enhanced theme context with department and auto-detect support
- Integrated clinical context detection
- Applied theme enhancements dynamically

### 6. **Design System Showcase** ✅
- Created comprehensive showcase component
- Added to main navigation under Developer Tools
- Interactive demonstration of all features

## Key Features

### 1. **Clinical Context Awareness**
- Automatically detects and adapts to:
  - Current department
  - Time of day (shift)
  - Urgency level
  - User role

### 2. **Micro-interactions**
- Smooth hover effects
- Contextual animations
- Loading states
- Transition effects

### 3. **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized for clinical workstations

### 4. **Accessibility**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- High contrast options
- Reduced motion support
- Keyboard navigation

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- Component memoization
- Lazy loading
- Optimized re-renders
- Efficient theme calculations

## Usage Examples

### Using MetricCard
```jsx
<MetricCard
  title="Active Problems"
  value={conditions.length}
  icon={<ConditionIcon />}
  trend={conditions.length > 0 ? 'critical' : 'healthy'}
  severity="high"
  department={department}
  clinicalContext={clinicalContext}
  expandable
>
  {/* Expandable content */}
</MetricCard>
```

### Using ClinicalCard
```jsx
<ClinicalCard
  title="Patient Information"
  icon={<PatientIcon />}
  department="emergency"
  variant="clinical"
  severity="medium"
  expandable
>
  {/* Card content */}
</ClinicalCard>
```

### Getting Clinical Context
```jsx
const clinicalContext = getClinicalContext(
  window.location.pathname,
  new Date().getHours(),
  department
);
```

## Theme Configuration

### Department Colors
- **General**: Blue (#1976D2)
- **Emergency**: Red (#D32F2F)
- **Cardiology**: Pink (#E91E63)
- **Pediatrics**: Green (#4CAF50)
- **Oncology**: Purple (#9C27B0)

### Severity Levels
- **Low**: Green indicators
- **Medium**: Yellow/Orange indicators
- **High**: Red indicators
- **Critical**: Red with animations

### Shift Themes
- **Day Shift**: Bright, high contrast
- **Night Shift**: Dimmed, reduced blue light
- **Emergency Shift**: Maximum contrast, critical indicators

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Components
1. Import clinical utilities: `import { getClinicalContext } from 'themes/clinicalThemeUtils'`
2. Add department prop to components
3. Replace Card with ClinicalCard where appropriate
4. Use MetricCard for statistics display
5. Add clinical context to child components

### For New Components
1. Always consider clinical context
2. Use theme clinical properties
3. Implement proper loading states
4. Add severity/urgency support where relevant
5. Follow responsive design patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Always pass department context** down through component trees
2. **Use semantic severity levels** for clinical indicators
3. **Implement loading states** for better UX
4. **Test with different departments** and shift times
5. **Consider accessibility** in all interactions
6. **Optimize for performance** with large datasets

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Voice command integration
- [ ] Gesture controls for touch devices
- [ ] AI-powered theme suggestions
- [ ] Custom department configurations
- [ ] Advanced animation controls
- [ ] Theme export/import functionality

## Conclusion

The enhanced design system provides a solid foundation for building intuitive, context-aware clinical interfaces. The system adapts to the user's environment and workflow, providing optimal visibility and usability in various clinical settings.
