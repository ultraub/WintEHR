# CDS Studio Fix Documentation

**Date**: 2025-01-26  
**Issue**: CDS Studio page broken after cleanup  
**Resolution**: Created wrapper components to restore functionality  

## Problem Summary

During cleanup (commit a8075f8), the entire `cds-studio/build/` directory was removed, including:
- CDSBuildMode.js
- CDSBuildModeImproved.js
- VisualConditionBuilder.js
- CardDesigner.js
- And all related components

However, the CDS Studio page (`/cds-studio`) was still actively used and imported these components, causing build errors.

## Solution

### 1. Component Discovery
Found that similar components exist in `clinical/workspace/cds/`:
- CDSHookBuilder (similar to CDSBuildMode)
- CardBuilder (similar to CardDesigner)
- SuggestionBuilder (same component)
- All condition builders (LabValue, VitalSign, Medical, etc.)

### 2. Created Wrapper Components
Created `CDSBuildModeWrapper.js` that:
- Exports `CDSBuildMode` and `CDSBuildModeImproved` components
- Wraps `CDSHookBuilder` from clinical workspace
- Provides context integration with `useCDSStudio`
- Handles save/cancel operations with proper metadata

### 3. Updated Imports
Changed CDSHooksStudio.js imports from:
```javascript
import CDSBuildMode from '../components/cds-studio/build/CDSBuildMode';
import CDSBuildModeImproved from '../components/cds-studio/build/CDSBuildModeImproved';
```

To:
```javascript
import { CDSBuildMode, CDSBuildModeImproved } from '../components/cds-studio/build/CDSBuildModeWrapper';
```

## Architecture

```
CDSHooksStudio (page)
├── Provides CDSStudioContext
├── Renders BuildModeWithErrorHandling
│   └── Returns CDSBuildModeImproved
│       └── Wrapper that uses CDSHookBuilder
│           └── From clinical/workspace/cds/
└── CDSManageMode uses useCDSStudio context
```

## Navigation

CDS Studio is accessible:
- Route: `/cds-studio`
- Redirect: `/cds-hooks` → `/cds-studio`
- Link: Patient Summary V4 dashboard has navigation button

## Future Considerations

1. **Component Consolidation**: Consider moving all CDS components to one location
2. **Context Simplification**: The wrapper adds complexity - consider refactoring
3. **Feature Parity**: CDSBuildModeImproved currently uses the same component as CDSBuildMode
4. **Testing**: Ensure all CDS Studio functionality works as expected

## Files Changed

- Created: `frontend/src/components/cds-studio/build/CDSBuildModeWrapper.js`
- Modified: `frontend/src/pages/CDSHooksStudio.js`

This fix restores CDS Studio functionality while reusing existing components from the clinical workspace.
