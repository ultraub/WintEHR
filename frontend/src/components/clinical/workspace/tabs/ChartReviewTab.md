## Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. **Clinical Data Integrity**
```javascript
// Proper status management
const updateConditionStatus = async (condition) => {
  if (condition.clinicalStatus.coding[0].code === 'resolved') {
    condition.abatementDateTime = new Date().toISOString();
  }
  await fhirService.updateCondition(condition.id, condition);
};
```

### 2. **User Safety**
```javascript
// Confirmation for critical actions
const handleDeleteCondition = async (condition) => {
  const confirmed = await confirm(
    `Delete ${condition.code.text}?`,
    'This action cannot be undone.'
  );
  if (confirmed) {
    await fhirService.deleteCondition(condition.id);
  }
};
```

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
```javascript
// Intelligent caching and memoization
const memoizedMedications = useMemo(() => 
  medications.filter(med => med.status === 'active'),
  [medications]
);
```
