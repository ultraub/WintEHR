# Testing FHIR Relationships Visualization

## Summary

Successfully implemented the FHIR Relationships visualization feature:

1. **Backend API** (`/api/fhir-relationships/*`):
   - Created endpoints for relationship discovery
   - Fixed API bugs (method names and attribute access)
   - Endpoints now working correctly

2. **Reference Population**:
   - Created script to populate fhir.references table
   - Successfully extracted 21,112 references from existing FHIR data
   - Handles both standard and urn:uuid reference formats

3. **Frontend Component** (RelationshipMapper.jsx):
   - Migrated from canvas to D3.js visualization
   - Integrated with backend API
   - Multiple layout options (force, radial, hierarchical, circular)

## Test Results

### API Test
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/fhir-relationships/discover/Patient/0288c42c-43a1-9878-4a9d-6b96caa12c40?depth=2"
```

Result: 
- 47 nodes discovered
- 50 relationships/links found
- Patient "Miki234 Kimiko714 Morar593" successfully loaded

### Reference Statistics
- Total references: 21,112
- Top relationships:
  - ExplanationOfBenefit → Practitioner: 2,148
  - ExplanationOfBenefit → Patient: 1,611
  - Observation → Patient: 1,416
  - Observation → Encounter: 1,416

## Next Steps

To use the Relationships viewer in the UI:
1. Navigate to FHIR Explorer v4
2. Click on the "Discovery" tab
3. Select "Relationships" 
4. Choose a resource type (e.g., Patient)
5. The visualization should now show actual relationships from the FHIR data

The visualization supports:
- Interactive force-directed graph
- Zoom and pan
- Multiple layout algorithms
- Node details on click
- Export as image
- Real-time layout adjustments
