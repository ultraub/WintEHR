# CDS Hooks Module Documentation

## Overview
The CDS Hooks module implements the HL7 CDS Hooks 1.0 specification, providing clinical decision support integration points throughout the EMR. It enables real-time, context-aware clinical guidance through standardized service discovery and card-based recommendations.

## Current Implementation Details

### Core Components
- **cds_hooks_router.py**: Main FastAPI router for CDS Hooks endpoints
- **cds_services.py**: Pre-configured clinical decision support rules
- **hook_persistence.py**: Database storage for custom hooks
- **models.py**: Pydantic models for CDS Hooks data structures

### Implemented Hooks
1. **patient-view**: Triggered when opening a patient chart
2. **medication-prescribe**: Fired during medication ordering
3. **order-review**: Activated during order review
4. **encounter-start**: Triggered at encounter initiation
5. **encounter-discharge**: Fired during discharge planning

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. **Service Registration**
```python
@router.get("/cds-hooks/services")
async def discover_services():
    """CDS Hooks discovery endpoint."""
    services = []
    
    for service_id, service in CDS_SERVICES.items():
        services.append({
            "hook": service["hook"],
            "id": service_id,
            "title": service["title"],
            "description": service["description"],
            "prefetch": service.get("prefetch", {})
        })
    
    return {"services": services}
```

### 2. **Context Processing**
```python
async def process_hook_request(
    service_id: str,
    request: CDSRequest,
    db: AsyncSession
) -> CDSResponse:
    """Process a CDS Hooks request."""
    
    # Get service definition
    service = get_service(service_id)
    
    # Extract context
    patient_id = request.context.get("patientId")
    user_id = request.context.get("userId")
    
    # Load additional data if needed
    if not request.prefetch:
        prefetch_data = await fetch_required_data(
            service.prefetch,
            patient_id,
            db
        )
    else:
        prefetch_data = request.prefetch
    
    # Evaluate rules
    cards = await evaluate_service_rules(
        service,
        request.context,
        prefetch_data
    )
    
    return CDSResponse(cards=cards)
```

### 3. **Card Generation**
```python
def create_card(
    summary: str,
    indicator: str = "info",
    detail: str = None,
    suggestions: List[dict] = None
) -> dict:
    """Create a CDS Hooks card."""
    card = {
        "uuid": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "summary": summary,
        "indicator": indicator,
        "source": {
            "label": "MedGenEMR CDS",
