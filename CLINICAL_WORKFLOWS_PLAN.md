## ✅ **Phase 0: System Stabilization - COMPLETED**

**Priority**: CRITICAL - PATIENT SAFETY RISK  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All blocking issues resolved  
**Dependencies**: None - Highest priority work  
**Completed**: 2025-07-13  

### **Overview**
Systematic infrastructure errors have been identified that create **patient safety risks** and complete system instability. Multiple critical systems are non-functional, including medication safety verification and core FHIR resource handling.

### **Identified Critical Issues**

### **2. Build on Existing Architecture**
- Leverage existing ClinicalWorkflowContext for all cross-module communication
- Use established FHIR patterns and fhirClient for all data operations
- Integrate with existing tab structure and component patterns
- Maintain event-driven architecture for workflow orchestration

### **3. Progressive Enhancement**
- Complete one phase fully before moving to next
- Each task builds upon previous functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing features
- Design for future advanced feature integration

### **4. Real Data Focus**
- Test all functionality with existing Synthea patient data
- Handle edge cases and missing data gracefully
- Validate FHIR compliance throughout development
- Ensure cross-patient functionality works reliably

### **5. User Experience Priority**
- Maintain intuitive workflow patterns
- Minimize clicks and redundant data entry
- Provide clear visual feedback and error handling
- Design for efficiency and speed of clinical use

### **6. Quality Assurance Framework**
- **Research & Preparation**: Mandatory documentation review and capability analysis before implementation
- **FHIR Compliance**: Validation against HL7.org standards with proper resource structure
