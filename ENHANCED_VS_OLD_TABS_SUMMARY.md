# Enhanced vs Old Clinical Tabs Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Issue**: Both ClinicalWorkspaceEnhanced and ClinicalWorkspaceV3 were using the same tab components

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Tab Imports in ClinicalWorkspaceEnhanced
The enhanced workspace now uses optimized versions where available:
- `ChartReviewTab` → `ChartReviewTabOptimized`
- `ResultsTab` → `ResultsTabOptimized`
- `OrdersTab` → `EnhancedOrdersTab`

### 2. Added Visual Indicator
- Added a green chip at the top showing "Enhanced Clinical Workspace v2 - Using Optimized Components"
- Added console.log to verify enhanced version is loading
- This is temporary and can be removed once verified

### 3. Enhanced Tab Features

#### ChartReviewTabOptimized:
- Uses specialized hooks for efficient resource loading
- Uses `useChartReviewResources` hook
- Includes ResourceDataGrid and dialogs for each resource type

#### ResultsTabOptimized:
- Fixed issues with repeated requests
- Consolidated data fetching
- Proper bundle handling
- Single source of truth for each data type

#### EnhancedOrdersTab:
- Comprehensive CPOE system
- Advanced FHIR R4 search capabilities
- Includes AdvancedOrderFilters
- Speed dial for quick actions
- Uses VirtualizedList for performance

## Next Steps

1. You should now see:
   - A green banner at the top confirming you're using the enhanced version
   - Console log: "ClinicalWorkspaceEnhanced: Using optimized tab components"
   - Different UI in Chart Review, Results, and Orders tabs

2. Once verified, you can remove:
   - The green banner
   - The console.log statement

3. Consider creating enhanced versions for:
   - SummaryTab
   - EncountersTab
   - PharmacyTab
   - Other tabs that still use the basic versions

## Key Differences to Look For

- **Chart Review**: Should have ResourceDataGrid and dialogs
- **Results**: Should have improved data loading and no duplicate requests
- **Orders**: Should have speed dial button and advanced filters

The enhanced tabs have better performance, more features, and improved UI compared to the basic versions.
