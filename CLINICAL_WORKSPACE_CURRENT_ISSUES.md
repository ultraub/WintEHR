# Clinical Workspace Current Issues Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Tab Navigation Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking on tabs in the sidebar doesn't change the content
**Root Cause**: The `ClinicalWorkspaceEnhanced` was managing its own `activeTab` state instead of using the parent's `activeModule`
**Fix Applied**: 
- Removed local `activeTab` state
- Use `activeModule` prop directly
- Fixed `onModuleChange` to pass tab ID instead of index

### 2. Sidebar Margin Issues
**Problem**: Extra 280px margin appearing inconsistently
**Current State**: 
- Desktop should always have margin (sidebar is permanent)
- Mobile should never have margin (sidebar is overlay)
- Margin calculation: `ml: isMobile ? 0 : ${sidebarWidth}px`

### 3. Remaining Issues to Fix

#### High Priority
1. **Department prop missing** - All tabs need to accept `department` prop
2. **Null safety in ResultsTab** - Deep property access without null checks
3. **Null safety in OrdersTab** - Deep property access without null checks

#### Medium Priority
1. **Prop validation** - Add PropTypes to tab components
2. **Shared utilities** - Extract common functions to avoid duplication

## Next Steps

1. Test tab navigation to ensure it's working
2. Verify sidebar margin behavior on different screen sizes
3. Add the missing department props to prevent crashes
4. Add null safety checks to prevent runtime errors
