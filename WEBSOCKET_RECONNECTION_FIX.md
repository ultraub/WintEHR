# WebSocket Reconnection Fix

**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Author**: AI Assistant

## Issue Description

WebSocket was showing as "Disconnected" and experiencing multiple connection attempts due to:
1. `currentUser` starting as null and changing to an object during auth loading
2. WebSocket being disconnected and reconnected on every `currentUser` change
3. Race condition where WebSocket was closed before connection established

## Root Cause

The WebSocket initialization useEffect in `ClinicalWorkflowContext.js` was:
1. Running every time `currentUser` changed (null â†’ object)
2. Disconnecting in cleanup function on every re-render
3. Not checking if already connected before attempting reconnection

## Solution Implemented

Updated `ClinicalWorkflowContext.js` with three key changes:

### 1. Added Connection State Check
```javascript
// Only connect if we have a user and token, and not already connected
if (currentUser && token && !wsConnected) {
  // Check if WebSocket is already connected to prevent reconnection
  const currentState = websocketService.getConnectionState();
  if (currentState.isConnected) {
    console.log('[ClinicalWorkflow] WebSocket already connected, skipping reconnection');
    setWsConnected(true);
    return;
  }
  // ... proceed with connection
}
```

### 2. Modified Cleanup Logic
```javascript
// Store cleanup function
return () => {
  // Only cleanup if component is unmounting or user is logging out
  console.log('[ClinicalWorkflow] WebSocket cleanup triggered');
  wsUnsubscribers.current.forEach(unsubscribe => unsubscribe());
  wsUnsubscribers.current = [];
  // Don't disconnect here - let the WebSocket manage its own lifecycle
};
```

### 3. Added Proper Unmount Cleanup
```javascript
// Cleanup WebSocket on component unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    console.log('[ClinicalWorkflow] Component unmounting, disconnecting WebSocket');
    websocketService.disconnect();
  };
}, []); // Only run on unmount
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Multiple Connections**: WebSocket only connects once when user is authenticated
2. **Stable Connection**: No more disconnect/reconnect cycles on state changes
3. **Proper Cleanup**: WebSocket properly disconnects only on component unmount
4. **Better Performance**: Fewer connection attempts mean less overhead

## Testing

After applying this fix:
1. WebSocket should connect once after authentication
2. Should stay connected during normal app usage
3. Should show "Connected" status consistently
4. Real-time updates should work without interruption
