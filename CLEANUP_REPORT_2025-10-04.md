## ⏭️ Files Deferred for Review (Phase 2)

### Deployment Documentation (4 files) - NEEDS DECISION
These files contain historical deployment information:

```
📋 AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md
   Decision needed: Keep if current production deployment, remove if superseded
   
📋 DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
   Decision needed: Check if information is now in main CLAUDE.md docs
   
📋 DEPLOYMENT_REPORT_wintehr.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com_20251003.md
   Decision needed: Archive for audit trail or remove if superseded
   
📋 aws-connection-troubleshooting.md
   Decision needed: Remove if AWS deployment no longer relevant
```

### Test Documentation (7 files) - CONSOLIDATION CANDIDATES
Historical test and investigation summaries that could be consolidated:

```
📋 backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/SEARCH_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md (2025-01-20)
   Recommendation: Archive if search fixes are complete
   
📋 backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/FHIR_TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
   Recommendation: Consolidate into main test docs
   
📋 backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/TEST_FAILURE_SUMMARY.md
   Recommendation: Remove if tests now pass
   
📋 backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/FHIR_API_TEST_ANALYSIS.md
   Recommendation: Consolidate into docs/FHIR_API_TEST_SUMMARY.md
   
📋 backend/scripts/testing/FHIR_SEARCH_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
   Recommendation: Information likely in CLAUDE.md now
   
📋 backend/scripts/testing/TOKEN_SEARCH_FIX_SUMMARY.md
   Recommendation: Information likely in CLAUDE.md now
   
📋 backend/scripts/testing/FHIR_SEARCH_COMPREHENSIVE_RESULTS.md
   Recommendation: Remove if tests passing consistently
```

## 🚫 Files Preserved

### Active Logs (1 file)
```
KEEP: azure-deploy-output.log (2.8 MB)
Reason: Currently being written by background deployment process
Action: Can be removed after deployment completes
```

### Core Documentation (Preserved)
All essential project documentation was preserved:
- CLAUDE.md (primary operational guide)
- CLAUDE-REFERENCE.md (detailed patterns)
- CLAUDE-AGENTS.md (agent system)
- All module-specific CLAUDE.md files
- All docs/ directory contents
- All test harnesses and active scripts

---

## 📈 Impact Analysis

### Disk Space Recovered
- **Immediate cleanup**: ~3.4 MB
- **Potential (after review)**: Additional ~500 KB

### Risk Assessment
- ✅ **Low Risk**: All removed files were:
  - Historical logs (can be regenerated)
  - Backup files (originals preserved in git)
  - Empty files (no data loss)

### Development Impact
- ✅ **Zero Impact**: No active files or documentation affected
- ✅ **Repository Cleaner**: Easier navigation, less confusion
- ✅ **Git History Preserved**: All original versions in git history

---

## 🎯 Recommendations for Phase 2

### Option 1: Archive Historical Documentation
```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p docs/archive/deployment
mkdir -p docs/archive/testing

# Move historical docs to archive
mv AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md docs/archive/deployment/
mv DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md docs/archive/deployment/
mv DEPLOYMENT_REPORT_*.md docs/archive/deployment/
mv backend/tests/fhir_comprehensive/*_SUMMARY.md docs/archive/testing/
```

### Option 2: Remove AWS-Specific Documentation
```bash
# If AWS deployment is no longer relevant
rm aws-connection-troubleshooting.md
```

### Option 3: Consolidate Test Documentation
```bash
# Review test summaries and consolidate into existing docs
# Then remove duplicates after merging relevant information
```

## 🛡️ Safety Measures Applied

1. **Git History Check**: Verified all files exist in git history
2. **Active Process Check**: Excluded currently-written log file
3. **Backup Verification**: Confirmed .bak files have originals
4. **Documentation Review**: Preserved all active CLAUDE.md files
5. **Low-Risk Focus**: Only removed logs, backups, and empty files
